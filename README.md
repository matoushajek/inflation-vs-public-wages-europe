# Impact of Inflation on Public Sector Wages in Europe

## Objective
This Power BI project analyzes whether public sector wages in European countries kept pace with inflation between 2016 and 2025.  
The goal is to evaluate how inflation affected real purchasing power across countries and over time.

## Data Sources
- Eurostat – HICP inflation index  
- Eurostat – Public sector wages (annual data)

## Methodology
- Inflation-adjusted wages calculated using 2016 as the base year  
- Real wages computed as:  
  **Real Wage = Nominal Wage / (Inflation Index / Base Inflation)**  
- Year-over-year real wage change calculated using YearID-based comparison

## Key Findings
- In several countries, nominal wages increased while real wages stagnated or declined  
- The inflation surge after 2021 created a visible divergence between nominal and real wages  
- Countries exhibit substantial heterogeneity in real wage dynamics

## Tools Used
- Power BI  
- DAX  
- Power Query
